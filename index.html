                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>My name is Phillip Brown, I'm a Game Design and Development major senior at Rochester Institute of Technology. I focus on game programming bringing designer's ideas to life. I have experience in Unity, Unreal, and Godot. However, I can and love to learn new skills within game design and development.</p>

                        <p>Group Project, Godot (GDScript)</p>
                        <p>This game was made for my Casual Game Design class where we focused on making a non-competitive game. This was the first time I used the Godot engine. We made this game over four months, January to April. My focus in making this game was on the player side of combat.</p>

                        <p>Group Project, Unity (C#)</p>
                        <p>This game was made for RIT Game Development Club's 2023 Spring Game Jam. The theme of the game jam was "Together," so we decided to make a puzzle platformer designed around two puzzle pieces that can split apart and come back together.</p>
                        <p>Here's a link to the game's itch.io page <a href="https://dancetrap.itch.io/pieced-together">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>Solo Project, Processing (Java)</p>
                        <p>This was the first game I ever made. I made it for my Introduction to Computer Science class in high school for my final project. Around the time I was playing a lot of platformers like Super Meat Boy, and most of my inspiration for the game is from those games. The entire game was made with just code except for the font used on the main menu.</p>

                        <p>Solo Project, Web App (Html, JavaScript)</p>
                        <p>This game was made for my Introduction to Web App Development class. I made this game to showcase the JavaScript and PIXI.js which I had learned.</p>

                        <p>Group Project, MonoGame (C#)</p>
                        <p>This game was made for my Game Development and Algorithm Problem Solving 2 class. This was the first time I worked in a group to design and develop a game. I got to experience working in an environment where I had to take other people's creative decisions into consideration when developing and designing. Also, even though we were all in the same class I had to get used to other people's coding standards and practices to streamline the process.</p>
